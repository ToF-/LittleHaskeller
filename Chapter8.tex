\lhQ We know how to compute a hand's ranking, and print that ranking. What do we need to do now?
\lhA We need to find the five card hand with the best ranking in an arbitrary list of cards.
\lhN How do we do that?
\lhA Just write a failing test.
\lhN Ok. Here we go:
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single]
bestRanking "6♥ 6♦ 6♠ 6♣" ~?= Nothing
\end{lstlisting}
In that case, the result is \il!Nothing! because the string represent a list of less than five cards. You know about \il!Nothing!, right ?
\lhA \error Yes. 
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single]
bestRanking :: String -> Maybe Ranking
bestRanking _ = Nothing
\end{lstlisting}
\success Your test is implying that \il!bestHand! consumes a \il!String! and returns, \il!Maybe!, a \il!Ranking!. 
\lhN That is correct. Here's another one:
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single]
bestRanking "6♣ 4♦ A♣ 3♠ K♠" ~?= Just HighCard
\end{lstlisting}
\lhA \failure I'll make it pass as fast as I can:
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single]
bestRanking :: String -> Maybe Ranking
bestRanking s | length (cards s) < 5 = Nothing
bestRanking s = Just HighCard
\end{lstlisting}
\success We just ignore list of less than 5 cards.
\lhN Ok. But there is still a \emph{fake}. Here's a new test:
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single]
bestRanking "6♣ 6♦ A♣ 3♠ K♠" ~?= Just Pair
\end{lstlisting}
\lhA Easy: we just yield the ranking
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single]
bestRanking :: String -> Maybe Ranking
bestRanking s | length (cards s) < 5 = Nothing
bestRanking s = Just (ranking (hand s))
\end{lstlisting}
\error Uh oh.
\lhN
\begin{small}
\begin{verbatim}
Not in scope: ranking
\end{verbatim}
\end{small}
We don't have a function \il!ranking!. We had one, but we renamed it.
\lhA Ok, here's the needed function:
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single]
ranking :: Hand -> Ranking
ranking (H r _) = r
\end{lstlisting}
\success and now the test passes.
\lhN Ok. Here's the really complicated case:
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single]
bestRanking "9♣ A♥ K♠ 3♣ K♦ 9♦ 6♦" ~?= Just TwoPairs
\end{lstlisting}
There are several possible five card hands we can form with these seven cards. Do you know how much?
\lhA Yes, ${{7}\choose{5}} = \frac{7\times6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3}{5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = \frac{2520}{120} = 21$
\lhN Do you know how to find them?
\lhA Sure: use the \il!subsequences! and \il!filter! functions:
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single]
subsequences :: [a] -> [[a]] 	-- Defined in Data.List
filter :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> [a] 	-- Defined in GHC.List
\end{lstlisting}
For example: 
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single]
> filter (\s -> length s == 2) $ subsequences "CAT"
["CA","CT","AT"]
\end{lstlisting} % $
\lhN Then do it. We test is still failing.
\lhA OK:\emph{to be continued}
