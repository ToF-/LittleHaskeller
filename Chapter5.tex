\lhQ So far, our hand comparisons are correct as long as we compare \emph{High Cards} hands or compare a \emph{High Card} to a \emph{Pair}. What's the next step ?
\lhA Comparing \emph{Pairs}.
\lhN Ok. Here's a test:
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single]
,"5♥ 4♦ 3♥ 2♦ 3♣" `beat` "5♥ 2♦ 3♥ 4♦ 2♥"]
    where beat h g = comparing hand h g ~?= GT
\end{lstlisting}
The hand on the left should win, since a pair of 3 beats a pair of 2s. But the test fails, we get \il!EQ! instead of \il!GT!.
\lhA \failure We can solve this by storing cards along with the \il!Pair! value in the \il!Hand! type:
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single]
data Hand = HighCard [Card]
          | Pair     [Card]
            deriving (Ord,Eq)
\end{lstlisting}
\lhN And we must complete the \il!hand! function, too.
\lhA \error Yes:
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single]
hand :: String -> Hand
hand s = case length gs  of
           4 -> Pair cs
           5 -> HighCard cs 
       where cs = sortBy (flip compare) $ cards s
             gs = groupBy (same value) cs
\end{lstlisting} %$
\success And now the test passes.
\lhN We have a problem, though. Can you see it ?
\lhA Not yet.
\lhN Look at the \il!hand! function. \\ What is the value of \il!cs! when \il!s! equals \il!"5♥ 4♦ 3♥ 2♦ 3♣"!?
\lhA That's \il![5, 4, 3, 3, 2]!.
\lhN And what would be the value of \il!cs! if \il!s! was equal to  \il!"5♥ 2♦ 3♥ 7♦ 2♦"!?
\lhA \il![7,5,3,2,2]!. Ouch.
\lhN Let's write a new test:
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single]
    ,"5♥ 4♦ 3♥ 3♣ 2♥" `beat` "7♦ 5♥ 3♦ 2♠ 2♦"]
\end{lstlisting}
\failure and sure enough the test is failing.
\lhA \failure I see. The value of the pair should beat the value of the remaining cards.
\lhN Do you know how to solve this?
\lhA No. 
\lhN What is the simplest possible thing that would make the tests pass ?
\lhA Using the \emph{fake it} strategy. We can arrange the cards according to their place in the groups list.
\lhN Well, do this, then.
\lhA I want to refactor the code, first. 
\lhN Ok I'm removing my last test
\lhA \success Thanks. Here's my refactoring:
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single]
hand :: String -> Hand
hand s = case gs  of
           [_,_,_,_]   -> Pair cs
           [_,_,_,_,_] -> HighCard cs 
       where cs = sortBy (flip compare) $ cards s
             gs = groupBy (same value) cs
\end{lstlisting} %$
\success Everything is still working fine.
\lhN What's the use of these patterns ?
\lhA \success Describing the two cases of \emph{Pair} that we have so far:
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single]
hand :: String -> Hand
hand s = case gs  of
           [[a],[b],[c],[d,e]] -> Pair cs
           [[a],[b],[c,d],[e]] -> Pair cs
           [_,_,_,_,_] -> HighCard cs 
       where cs = sortBy (flip compare) $ cards s
             gs = groupBy (same value) cs
\end{lstlisting} %$
\success Please put your last test back in the code.
\lhN Here it is :
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single]
    ,"5♥ 4♦ 3♥ 3♣ 2♥" `beat` "7♦ 5♥ 3♦ 2♠ 2♦"]
\end{lstlisting}
\failure Still failing.
\lhA \failure Those variables will be used to rearrange the \il!Pair! value. 
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single]
hand :: String -> Hand
hand s = case gs  of
           [[a],[b],[c],[d,e]] -> Pair [d,e,a,b,c]
           [[a],[b],[c,d],[e]] -> Pair [c,d,a,b,e]
           [_,_,_,_,_] -> HighCard cs 
       where cs = sortBy (flip compare) $ cards s
             gs = groupBy (same value) cs
\end{lstlisting} %$
\success And now the pairs are correctly compared.
\lhN Ok. What if we have pairs on the highest values ? It wouldn't match our two patterns. 
\lhA I told you it was a \emph{fake}. Everything would be fine if we always one pattern for pairs: \il![[a,b],[c],[d],[e]]!
\lhN How can we ensure we always have this pattern for pairs?
\lhA By sorting the groups by size, descending:
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single]
hand :: String -> Hand
hand s = case gs  of
           [[a],[b],[c],[d,e]] -> Pair [d,e,a,b,c]
           [[a],[b],[c,d],[e]] -> Pair [c,d,a,b,e]
           [_,_,_,_,_] -> HighCard cs 
       where cs = sortBy (flip compare) $ cards s
             gs = sortBy (flip groupSize) $ groupBy (same value) cs
             groupSize  = comparing length 
\end{lstlisting}
\failure Now we have errors.
\lhN That's because we now have non-exhaustive patterns in our three last tests.
\lhA \failure Of course. Let's put the only remaining possible pair pattern:
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single]
hand :: String -> Hand
hand s = case gs  of
           [[a,b],[c],[d],[e]] -> Pair [a,b,c,d,e]
           [_,_,_,_,_] -> HighCard cs 
       where cs = sortBy (flip compare) $ cards s
             gs = sortBy (flip groupSize) $ groupBy (same value) cs
             groupSize  = comparing length 
\end{lstlisting}
\success And everything is fine again.
