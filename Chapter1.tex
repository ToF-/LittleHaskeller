\lhright What is this : \il!"8h"! ?
\lhleft A \il!String!.
\lhnext Yes. What does it represent ?
\lhleft A height of hearts, or \hearts8.
\lhnext What \il!"7c 6d 9s"! represent ?
\lhleft Some others cards: \clubs7, \diamonds6, and \spades9.
\lhnext Right. And what does \il!"Ah Kh Qh Jh Th"! represent ?
\lhleft It represents victory: it's a royal flush.
\lhnext What is the best we can do with the following: \\
 \diamonds4 \diamonds2 \spades K \diamonds K \diamonds9 \clubs3 \diamonds6 ?
\lhleft A flush.
\lhnext And with \clubs9 \hearts A \spades K \diamonds K \diamonds9 \clubs3 \diamonds6 ?
\lhleft Two pairs.
\lhnext Correct. And with \clubs A \clubs Q \spades K \diamonds K \diamonds9 \clubs3 ?
\lhleft Nothing, because there are less than seven cards.
\lhnext And with \hearts9 \spades5 ?
\lhleft Nothing, for the same reason.
\lhnext That's right. \\
What about \clubs K \spades9 \spades K \diamonds K \diamonds9  \clubs3 \diamonds6 ?
\lhleft It's a full house. Say, why are you showing me all these cards ?
\lhnext Because we have a problem, and I wanted to be sure you know the basics about \emph{Poker}.
\lhleft Show me what the problem is.
\lhnext We have to write a program wich, given this input:
\begin{verbatim}
Kc 9s Ks Kd 9d 3c 6d
9c Ah Ks Kd 9d 3c 6d
Ac Qc Ks Kd 9d 3c
9h 5s
4d 2d Ks Kd 9d 3c 6d
7s Ts Ks Kd 9d
\end{verbatim}
\hspace*{\fill} 
\lhleft These are the cards of some players in a game of \emph{Texas Hold'em}. Right ?
\lhnext -- right -- ..would output this:
\begin{verbatim}
Kc 9s Ks Kd 9d 3c 6d Full House (winner)
9c Ah Ks Kd 9d 3c 6d Two Pair
Ac Qc Ks Kd 9d 3c 
9h 5s 
4d 2d Ks Kd 9d 3c 6d Flush
7s Ts Ks Kd 9d 
\end{verbatim}
\hspace*{\fill} 
\lhleft I see. 
\lhnext What do you see ?
\lhleft Some lines are just left as they are. \\
Some lines are marked with the ranking of the best possible hand given the cards on the line.\\
The line with the best ranking is marked as the winner.
\lhnext Do you think we can solve the problem ?
\lhleft Yes, provided we have the good tools.
\lhnext What is the value of:  \il!filter even [4,8,0,7]! ?
\lhleft \il![4,8,0]!
\lhnext What is the value of:  \il!subsequences "abc"! ?
\lhleft \il!["","a","b","ab","c","ac","bc","abc"]!
\lhnext And the expression: \il!maximum [4,8,0,7]! ? 
\lhleft \il!8!
\lhnext What about: \il!zip [3,5,2] "abc"! ?
\lhleft \il![(3,'a'),(5,'b'),(2,'c')]!
\lhnext and  the expression: \il!zipWith (*)__ [3,5,2] [4,9,7]! ?
\lhleft \il![12, 45, 14]!
\lhnext What is the value of: \\ \il!words "time flies like an arrow"! ?
\lhleft \il!["time","flies","like","an","arrow"]!
\lhnext What is the value of: \il!compare "time"__"arrow"! ?
\lhleft \il!GT!, because \il!"time" > "arrow"!
\lhnext What is the value of:\\ \il!comparing length "time"__"arrow"! ?
\lhleft \il!LT!, because \il!(length "time")__< (length "arrow)"!
\lhnext Do you want to solve the problem ? 
\lhleft Let's make some tea first.
