\lhQ What is the next task with regard to card comparison?
\lhA We need to compare suits so that we can find a \emph{flush}.
\lhN Ok I'll write a test:
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single]
ud = words "A♣ 2♣ T♣ K♣ 9♣ Q♣ J♣"
sd = words "2♣ 9♣ T♣ J♣ Q♣ K♣ A♣"

main = runTestTT $ TestList 
       [sortBy (comparing card) ud  ~?= sd
       ,flush (cards "A♣ T♣ 3♣ 4♣ 2♣") ~?= True]
    where cards = map card . words
\end{lstlisting} % $ 
\hspace*{\fill}
\lhA \error Let's write a function \il!flush!
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single]
flush :: [Card] -> Bool
flush _ = True
\end{lstlisting}
\success Done.
\lhN I see. Still the \emph{fake it 'til you make it} approach.
\lhA This is the simplest thing that makes the test pass.
\lhN Ok. Here is another test:
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single]
main = runTestTT $ TestList 
       [sortBy (comparing card) ud  ~?= sd
       ,flush (cards "A♣ T♣ 3♣ 4♣ 2♣") ~?= True
       ,flush (cards "A♠ T♣ 3♣ 4♣ 2♣") ~?= False ]
    where cards = map card . words
\end{lstlisting} % $
Can you make it pass?
\lhA \failure I don't think so.
\lhN What is missing?
\lhA The \il!Card! type doesn't include suits.
\lhN How can we change that?
\lhA Add a failing test on getting \il!Suit!s from \il!Card!s.
\lhN Ok, then I'll replace my last test with this one:
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single]
main = runTestTT $ TestList 
       [sortBy (comparing card) ud  ~?= sd
       ,flush (cards "A♣ T♣ 3♣ 4♣ 2♣") ~?= True
       ,map suit (cards "A♣ A♦ A♣ A♠") ~?= ['♣','♦','♣','♠']]
    where cards = map card . words
\end{lstlisting} % $
Can you make this one pass?  
\lhA \error First we need a \il!suit! function:
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single]
type Suit = Char

suit :: Card -> Suit
suit _ = '♣'
\end{lstlisting}
\failure Now the test is failing.
\lhN What else is needed?
\lhA \failure We must store the suit into to the \il!Card! type:
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single]
data Card = C Value Suit deriving (Ord,Eq)
\end{lstlisting}
And then we have to capture the suit in the \il!card! function:
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single]
card :: String -> Card
card ['A',s] = C 14 s
card ['K',s] = C 13 s
card ['Q',s] = C 12 s
card ['J',s] = C 11 s
card ['T',s] = C 10 s
card [c,s] = C ((ord c) - (ord '0')) s
\end{lstlisting}
\lhN \failure The code in the \il!card! function is a bit tedious, don't you think?
\lhA \failure I'll refactor it when the bar is green. I still have to remove the \emph{fake} on \il!suit!:
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single]
suit :: Card -> Suit
suit (C _ s) = s
\end{lstlisting}
\success And now we can get \il!Suit!s from \il!Card!s.
\lhN Good. Refactor the code, now.
\lhA \success Allright. First I can discard the \il!suit! function by declaring labels:
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single]
data Card = C { value :: Value, suit :: Suit } 
            deriving (Ord,Eq)
\end{lstlisting}
Then I can separate concerns in the \il!card! function:
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single]
card :: String -> Card
card [v,s] = C (toValue v) s
    where 
      toValue 'A' = 14
      toValue 'K' = 13
      toValue 'Q' = 12
      toValue 'J' = 11
      toValue 'T' = 10
      toValue  c  = ((ord c) - (ord '0'))
\end{lstlisting}
\success Done.
\lhN Can I add my test on \il!flush! now?
\lhA Yes.
\lhN Here it is:
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single]
main = runTestTT $ TestList 
       [sortBy (comparing card) ud  ~?= sd
       ,flush (cards "A♣ T♣ 3♣ 4♣ 2♣") ~?= True
       ,map suit (cards "A♣ A♦ A♣ A♠") ~?= ['♣','♦','♣','♠']
       ,flush (cards "A♠ T♣ 3♣ 4♣ 2♣") ~?= False]
    where cards = map card . words
\end{lstlisting} % $
Do you see how to make it pass?
\lhA \failure Sure: 
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single]
flush :: [Card] -> Bool
flush (c:_) = suit c == '♣'
\end{lstlisting}
\success As you see, it's a \emph{fake}.
\lhN In that case, I'll add a new test :
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single]
main = runTestTT $ TestList 
       [sortBy (comparing card) ud  ~?= sd
       ,flush (cards "A♣ T♣ 3♣ 4♣ 2♣") ~?= True
       ,map suit (cards "A♣ A♦ A♥ A♠") ~?= ['♣','♦','♣','♠']
       ,flush (cards "A♠ T♣ 3♣ 4♣ 2♣") ~?= False
       ,flush (cards "A♠ T♠ 3♠ 4♠ 2♠") ~?= True]
    where cards = map card . words
\end{lstlisting} % $
\hspace*{\fill}
\lhA \failure Ok. I think I can take a more general approach:
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single]
flush :: [Card] -> Bool
flush (c:cs) = all (\x -> suit x == suit c) cs
\end{lstlisting}
\success Of course, we're assuming that the \il!flush! function will always consume non-empty lists. 
\lhN Ok. This are the tests so far:
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single]
module Tests
where 
import Test.HUnit
import PokerHand
import Data.Ord (comparing)
import Data.List (sort,sortBy)

ud = words "A♣ 2♣ T♣ K♣ 9♣ Q♣ J♣"
sd = words "2♣ 9♣ T♣ J♣ Q♣ K♣ A♣"

main = runTestTT $ TestList 
       [sortBy (comparing card) ud  ~?= sd
       ,map suit (cards "A♣ A♦ A♥ A♠") ~?= ['♣','♦','♥','♠']
       ,flush (cards "A♣ T♣ 3♣ 4♣ 2♣") ~?= True
       ,flush (cards "A♠ T♣ 3♣ 4♣ 2♣") ~?= False
       ,flush (cards "A♠ T♠ 3♠ 4♠ 2♠") ~?= True]
    where cards = map card . words
\end{lstlisting} % $
\hspace*{\fill}
\lhA And this is the tested code:
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single]
module PokerHand
where
import Char

data Card = C { value :: Value, suit :: Suit } 
            deriving (Ord,Eq)
type Value = Int
type Suit = Char

card :: String -> Card
card [v,s] = C (toValue v) s
    where 
      toValue 'A' = 14
      toValue 'K' = 13
      toValue 'Q' = 12
      toValue 'J' = 11
      toValue 'T' = 10
      toValue  c  = ((ord c) - (ord '0'))

flush :: [Card] -> Bool
flush (c:cs) = all (\x -> suit x == suit c) cs
\end{lstlisting}
\lhN Are we done with comparing cards?
\lhA I think so. Let's have lunch.
