\lhQ What is the next task with regard to card comparison ?
\lhA We need to compare suits so that we can find a \emph{flush}.
\lhN Ok I'll write a test:
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single]
ud = words "A__c 2__c T__c K__c 9__c Q__c J__c"
sd = words "2__c 9__c T__c J__c Q__c K__c A__c"

main = runTestTT $ TestList 
       [sortBy (comparing card) ud  ~?= sd
       ,flush (cards "A__c T__c 3__c 4__c 2__c") ~?= True]
    where cards = map card . words
\end{lstlisting} % $ 
\hspace*{\fill}
\lhA \error Let's write a function \il!flush!
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single]
flush :: [Card] -> Bool
flush _ = True
\end{lstlisting}
\success Done.
\lhN I see. Still the \emph{fake it 'til you make it} approach.
\lhA This is the simplest thing that makes the test pass.
\lhN Ok. Here is another test:
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single]
main = runTestTT $ TestList 
       [sortBy (comparing card) ud  ~?= sd
       ,flush (cards "A__c T__c 3__c 4__c 2__c") ~?= True
       ,flush (cards "A__s T__c 3__c 4__c 2__c") ~?= False ]
    where cards = map card . words
\end{lstlisting} % $
Can you make it pass ?
\lhA \failure I don't think so.
\lhN What is missing ?
\lhA The \il!Card! type doesn't include suits.
\lhN How can we change that ?
\lhA Add a failing test on getting \il!Suit!s from \il!Card!s.
\lhN Ok, then I'll replace my last test with this one:
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single]
main = runTestTT $ TestList 
       [sortBy (comparing card) ud  ~?= sd
       ,flush (cards "A__c T__c 3__c 4__c 2__c") ~?= True
       ,map suit (cards "A__c A__d A__c A__s") ~?= ['__c','__d','__c','__s']]
    where cards = map card . words
\end{lstlisting} % $
Can you make this one pass ?  
\lhA \error First we need a \il!suit! function:
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single]
type Suit = Char

suit :: Card -> Suit
suit _ = '__c'
\end{lstlisting}
\failure Now the test is failing.
\lhN What else is needed ?
\lhA \failure We must store the suit into to the \il!Card! type:
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single]
data Card = C Value Suit deriving (Ord,Eq)
\end{lstlisting}
And then we have to capture the suit in the \il!card! function:
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single]
card :: String -> Card
card ['A',s] = C 14 s
card ['K',s] = C 13 s
card ['Q',s] = C 12 s
card ['J',s] = C 11 s
card ['T',s] = C 10 s
card [c,s] = C ((ord c) - (ord '0')) s
\end{lstlisting}
\lhN \failure The code in the \il!card! function is a bit tedious, don't you think ?
\lhA \failure I'll refactor it when the bar is green. I still have to remove the \emph{fake} on \il!suit!:
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single]
suit :: Card -> Suit
suit (C _ s) = s
\end{lstlisting}
\success And now we can get \il!Suit!s from \il!Card!s.
\lhN Good. Refactor the code, now.
\lhA \success Allright.
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single]
card :: String -> Card
card [v,s] = C (value v) s
    where 
      value 'A' = 14
      value 'K' = 13
      value 'Q' = 12
      value 'J' = 11
      value 'T' = 10
      value  c  = ((ord c) - (ord '0'))
\end{lstlisting}
\success Done.
\lhN Can I add my test on \il!flush! now ?
\lhA Yes.
\lhN Here it is:
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single]
main = runTestTT $ TestList 
       [sortBy (comparing card) ud  ~?= sd
       ,flush (cards "A__c T__c 3__c 4__c 2__c") ~?= True
       ,map suit (cards "A__c A__d A__c A__s") ~?= ['__c','__d','__c','__s']
       ,flush (cards "A__s T__c 3__c 4__c 2__c") ~?= False]
    where cards = map card . words
\end{lstlisting} % $
Do you see how to make it pass ?
\lhA \failure Sure: 
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single]
flush :: [Card] -> Bool
flush (c:_) = suit c == '__c'
\end{lstlisting}
\success As you see, it's a \emph{fake}.
\lhN In that case, I'll add a new test :
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single]
main = runTestTT $ TestList 
       [sortBy (comparing card) ud  ~?= sd
       ,map suit (cards "A__c A__d A__h A__s") ~?= ['__c','__d','__c','__s']
       ,flush (cards "A__c T__c 3__c 4__c 2__c") ~?= True
       ,flush (cards "A__s T__c 3__c 4__c 2__c") ~?= False
       ,flush (cards "A__s T__s 3__s 4__s 2__s") ~?= True]
    where cards = map card . words
\end{lstlisting} % $
\hspace*{\fill}
\lhA \failure Ok. I think I can take a more general approach:
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single]
flush :: [Card] -> Bool
flush (c:cs) = all (\x -> suit x == suit c) cs
\end{lstlisting}
\success Of course, we're assuming that the \il!flush! function will always consume non-empty lists. 
\lhN Are we done with comparing cards ?
\lhA I think so. Let's have lunch.
